html4tree
=========

## Description

This program generates index.html files based on a file directory tree.
Think Apache mod_autoindex.
See [https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_autoindex.html](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_autoindex.html).
It is written in Kotlin.
It is very simple.

## Motivation

I wrote this program because I figured that it would take me less time to write it 
than to (continue) search(ing) for it using a search engine.
