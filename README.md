## To exclude files from the generated index.html file

To exclude files place a `.html4ignore` file in the directory you wish to exclude particular files with each line of the file containing a valid regular expression that would match the filename you wish to exclude.

example:  to exclude files that end in `.txt` you could use the following in the `.html4ignore` file:

`.*.txt`

`$ find <top directory to crawl> -name index.html -delete`
